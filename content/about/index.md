Hello! My name is Vaishnav and I specialize in proactively identifying, exploiting, and mitigating vulnerabilities within networks, applications, and systems before malicious actors can leverage them. My interest in cybersecurity started back in 2019 when I finished watching a brilliant TV show called <strong>Mr. Robot</strong> — turns out, diving into the world of digital anarchy ignited a passion that pushed me into ethical hacking.

Driven by a hacker mindset, I perform targeted penetration testing across web apps, networks, and binaries—focusing on manual analysis, custom exploit development, and logic-based attack vectors. Skilled in reverse engineering C/C, x86 x64, source code review, and cryptographic flaw discovery. Experienced in low-noise recon, scripting, and chaining vulnerabilities to simulate real-world attacks effectively
